# Facial Recognition using DeepFace 🎭🔍

## Introduction
Welcome to the Facial Recognition using DeepFace project! 🧑‍💻 This project dives into the world of facial recognition technology, leveraging the power of the DeepFace library to perform real-time face verification.

## The verify_face Function 🧐
The *verify_face* function is the heart of the facial recognition logic. Here's what it does:

- **Functionality**: It takes a frame from the video feed, a reference image, and a result container as inputs. Using the DeepFace library, it compares the face in the frame with the face in the reference image to verify if they match.

- **Implementation**: It's designed to run in a separate thread every 30 frames to ensure smooth real-time operation without slowing down the video feed. If there's no face detected or if the comparison fails, it safely sets the result to False to avoid errors.

## The main Function 🎬
The *main* function orchestrates the entire process:

- **Initialization**: It sets up the video capture, loads the reference image, and initializes variables for tracking results.

- **Main Loop**: Runs in a continuous loop, capturing frames from the camera. Every 30 frames, it triggers the verify_face function in a separate thread for performance efficiency.

- **Display**: Based on the verification result, it overlays "MATCH!" in green or "NO MATCH!" in red on the video feed, providing real-time feedback to the user.

- **Exit**: The loop breaks when the user presses 'q', ensuring a graceful shutdown by releasing the camera and closing all OpenCV windows.
