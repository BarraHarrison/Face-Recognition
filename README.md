# Facial Recognition using DeepFace 🎭🔍

## Introduction
Welcome to the Facial Recognition using DeepFace project! 🧑‍💻 This project dives into the world of facial recognition technology, leveraging the power of the DeepFace library to perform real-time face verification.

## The verify_face Function 🧐
The verify_face function is the heart of the facial recognition logic. Here's what it does:

- **Functionality**: It takes a frame from the video feed, a reference image, and a result container as inputs. Using the DeepFace library, it compares the face in the frame with the face in the reference image to verify if they match.

- **Implementation**: It's designed to run in a separate thread every 30 frames to ensure smooth real-time operation without slowing down the video feed. If there's no face detected or if the comparison fails, it safely sets the result to False to avoid errors.
